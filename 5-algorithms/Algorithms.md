# Algorithms

## Algorithm Characteristics

* ### Algorithm complexity

    * Space complexity: How much memory does it require?
    * Time complexity: How much time does it take to complete?

* ### Input and output

    * What does the algorithm accept and what are the results?


* ### Classification

    * Serial/parallel
    * Exact/approximate
    * Deterministic/non-deterministic


## Common Algorithms

* ### Search algorithms

    * Find specific data in a structure(for example, a substring within a string)
    
* ### Sorting algorithms

    * Take a dataset and apply a sort order to it

* ### Computational algorithms

    * Given one set of data, calculate another(is a given number prime?)

* ### Collection algorithms

    * Work with collections of data(count specific items, navigate among elements, filter out unwanted data)
